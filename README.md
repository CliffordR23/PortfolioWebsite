🚀 How It Works

This portfolio website uses Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for better performance and SEO. The backend functionality is powered by Node.js, which handles API routes to process form submissions and dynamic content. Yarn is used as the package manager to efficiently handle dependencies and scripts.

Next.js Features Used:

Server-side rendering (SSR) for fetching real-time data

Static site generation (SSG) for improved performance

API Routes in pages/api/ for handling form submissions

Dynamic Routing for project pages

Node.js Usage:

Built-in API routes using Next.js (pages/api/) to process user interactions

Backend logic to manage form submissions

Secure environment variables for sensitive data handling

Yarn Usage:

Use instead of npm for faster and more efficient dependency management

Installed all project dependencies with yarn install

Managed scripts such as yarn dev to run the development server

Optimized package resolution and caching for better project performance
